Luau Local Ripper is a very simple python script that reads code from a file and outputs a new file that contains all of the locals and what line these locals can be found at.

# How to use
Simply put the python script in a folder and make a txt file in that same folder called "code.txt", after that just paste the code you want to rip inside of "code.txt" and run the python script.
